# Explicit_Two-Derivative_Two-Step_Runge-Kutta_Methods_TDTSRK
This work builds the order accuracy conditions for Two-Derivative Two-Step Runge-Kutta Methods (TDTSRK).
There are two devices to build the order conditions for Runge-Kutta methods: rooted trees[1] and Albrecht's approach[2].
The code file shows that the order accuracy conditions for TDTSRK by Albrecht's approach, and verified the coefficients are equivalent for the conditions by rooted trees theory[3].
